Figures of Visualization Graphs in the ICLEA 2025 Paper

We created a research website and set up an environment where Moodle and the Superset dashboard can be displayed simultaneously using the <iframe> tag. The left side of Figure 1 is the Moodle screen, and the right side is the dashboard screen visualized by Apache Superset.
